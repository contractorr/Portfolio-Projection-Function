        starting_amount(float): the initial amount to be invested
        interest_rate(float): the average interest rate we will assume will apply for the duration of our investment. E.g. 8% interest should be input as 8.

        beginning_year(int, optional): the tax year you intend to make the initial investment
        annual_topup(float, optional): any additional funds to be added to the portfolio on an annual basis, at the start of each tax year
        topup_years(int, optional): the number of years that the annual_topup amount will be added to the portfolio
    Returns:
        results: a list containing a list of each of the below:
                 1. The years over which the portfolio is held 
                 2. The cumulative value of the portfolio at the end of the given tax year
                 3. The interest earned
                 4. The tax paid 
                 5. The total amount of money invested 
             
        Assumptions:
            * The tax-free allowance for capital gains tax is Â£12500
            * The tax rate above the tax-free threshold is 40%
            * Capital gains tax: 
                We assume that we sell some fraction of our portfolio each year (and reinvest it in different shares). The amount of capital gains tax will 
                depend on the profit made on the shares sold. This in turn will depend on the average age of the shares sold. We assume we sell 20% of our 
                portfolio every year, selling oldest shares first. Under this assumption the average age of our shares stabilises after 5 years at 3.8 years.
